<h1> All About Me <hr /></h1>
    
    <!-- This introduces me and a little about my family -->

    <p> Hello! I am Emily Trainer and I am 15 years old.<b> I live in North East, MD </b>. I live near the water, so I boat a lot during the summer. I have two younger siblings. Hannah is 12, and Matthew is 10. We have a cat named Ollie. He is almost two years old, and scratches everything. We used to have a shih tzu, but we gave him to my grandparents after their dog passed away. I still consider him my dog. </p>
    
    <!-- This is a paragraph explaining about my favorite sport -->
    
    <P> My favorite sport to play is <b> basketball </b>. I have been playing since kindergaten. I now play on JV for Padua. I was not able to play last year becuase I got injured. I also got injured this year, but made the team. Fun Fact I can spin a basketball on my finger for 2 minutes and 37 seconds. Being able to play this year has been great, and I enjoy it a lot.</P>
    
    <!-- This paragraph is about my summer job -->
    
<P> My family owns a boat marina so I work there most of the summer. My dad works at the store where he sells boat, and all the billing is done. My uncle works at the docks were you can put your boat in the water, or if you need anything mechanical fixed with it. I work at the docks. I usually clean and detail boats and work the gas docks. I love working out there since I can get tan but it is a long exhausting day. </P>
   
<!-- This shows my favorite quote and favorite movie -->  
    
<blockquote> "You miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take" </blockquote> <p> This is my favorite quote. It reminds me that you can't succeed unless you try. My favorite movie by far is <I>Pitch Perfect</I>. I love the whole series but the first one if my favorite. It is so funny and I know almost all of the words. </p>
